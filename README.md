🛒 E-Commerce Business Analysis Using SQL


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a real-world e-commerce database using SQL to understand how an online retail business operates. The analysis explores customer purchasing behavior, product and seller performance, and overall revenue patterns.

E-commerce platforms generate large volumes of transactional data every day, but raw data alone does not provide clarity. This project demonstrates how structured SQL analysis can transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that support better decision-making.

🎯 Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this project was to answer practical business questions such as:

👥 How customers behave over time and whether they return after their first purchase

📦 Which products and categories contribute most to revenue

🏪 How sellers perform in terms of order fulfillment and revenue generation

📈 How revenue and order volume change over time

The goal was not just to write SQL queries, but to understand the business story behind the data.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The analysis is based on a publicly available Brazilian e-commerce dataset that closely resembles a real production database used by online marketplaces.

This dataset was chosen because it is:

✅ Well structured and relational

🔄 Representative of real e-commerce workflows

🧩 Suitable for multi-table analysis and realistic business scenarios

Although the dataset is from Brazil, the underlying business logic of e-commerce is universal. Concepts such as customers, orders, products, payments, and sellers remain consistent across countries.

🗃️ Tables Used

The analysis focuses on six core tables that represent the complete e-commerce transaction lifecycle:
